Releases:

Release 0.3.1 -- Added all flight dynamics to the MAV and added controls for the user
Release 0.2.1 -- Completed the rest of the flight dynamics equations and added basic "moves" to elicit realistic behavior in sim.  You are doing great!  Keep it up 10/10.
Release 0.1.2 -- Added airplane visualization and a simple flight path demo to the simulation. Grade 10/10
Release 0.1.1 -- Hello world, basic files added, pipenv added
Release 0.0.1 -- Initial commit and repo set up
