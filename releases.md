Repository Description: Airplane simulation in Python to support ECE 5353 Spring 2024.  This software will model many aspects of a small airplane including dynamics, sensors, and controls.  It will also provide a visualization and strip charts of relevant data.

Releases:

Release 0.8.2 -- Corrected GPS Course Equation / Graph

Release 0.8.1 -- Added Gyro, Accel, Pressure, and GPS Sensors

Release 0.7.3 -- Added tuning for chi and phi

Release 0.7.2 -- Fixed lack of negative sign on pdot in true_state.gamma, everyhing runs way smooter now

Release 0.7.1 -- Added other controllers and successfully completed all test cases

Release 0.6.1 -- Yaw damper and Trim control fully implemented

Release 0.5.2 -- Made a lot of changes and fixed issues in forces_moments function in mav_dynamics_control that was causing issues

Release 0.5.1 -- Implemented Trim functionality into chapter 5 project and completed compute_models.py file

Release 0.4.1 -- Added automatic trim functionality

Release 0.3.1 -- Added all flight dynamics to the MAV and added controls for the user 12/12.  Good.

Release 0.2.1 -- Completed the rest of the flight dynamics equations and added basic "moves" to elicit realistic behavior in sim.  You are doing great!  Keep it up 10/10.

Release 0.1.2 -- Added airplane visualization and a simple flight path demo to the simulation. Grade 10/10

Release 0.1.1 -- Hello world, basic files added, pipenv added

Release 0.0.1 -- Initial commit and repo set up
